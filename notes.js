//react - it contains the core react code
//reactDOM - it contains the code sepcific for DOM operations like for mobile we have reatc native and react 3d.

//React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello world from react!");
//{} - inside this we pass attributes to tag.

// React.createElement() - created a object(a react object) when then gets converted to node/html in browser by render function.

//React.render relaces the content inside the id root html element and places the content passed to render function.

//react is called as library because it can work on very small portion of html (ex. header/footer/sidebar)
